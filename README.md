The game is a ripoff of Vampire Survivors.
Players have to stay alive, avoiding enemies while the avatar's automatically shoot in the direction of the closest one. When enough XP pellets are consumed by a player, he can choose what to upgrade (extra damage or faster fire rate).
Game is over when both players are dead.
